/**
 * Production build orchestrator for Netlify. Runs `npm run build`, then
 * strips R2-mirrored data subdirs out of out/ from inside the same Node
 * process so Netlify can't skip it.
 *
 * Background: the original setup relied on either an `npm postbuild`
 * lifecycle hook or a `command = "npm run build && node strip..."` chain
 * in netlify.toml. Neither fired on Netlify — the upload phase ballooned
 * to ~162k files and blew the 18-minute build budget. Doing the strip
 * directly inside the build command's Node process avoids whatever
 * runtime path was skipping the other approaches.
 *
 * We do NOT remove the R2 subdirs from public/ before the build:
 * `generateStaticParams` for team/player pages needs to read those JSONs
 * to enumerate slugs and render content. Stashing them out broke every
 * `/teams/<slug>/` page (404'd because readTeam returned null).
 *
 * Mirror DIRS with R2_DIRS in src/lib/data-url.ts when adding new R2
 * subdirs.
